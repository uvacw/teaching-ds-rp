Hi students,

This is the course Digital Society Minor: Research Project. In this repo, we will collect some code examples for you. Note that this repo is work in progress - we will add relevant code during the course. Please also revisit the course materials from CCS1 and CCS2 for more background information.

## General setup

### Week 1

In week 1, we focus on the development of a recommender system. In fact, you already did this in CCS2. You are free to re-use materials from there. However, focus on the *comparison* between multiple setups.

### Week 2

In week 2, we finalize the research materials to be ready for data collection.

### Week 3

In week 3, we work on data analysis and visualize your 
research results.

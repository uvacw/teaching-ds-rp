Digital Society Minor: Research Project

Hi students,

This is the course Digital Society Minor: Research Project. In this repo, we will collect some code examples for you. Note that this repo is work in progress - we will add relevant code during the course. Please also revisit the course materials from CCS1 and CCS2 for more background information.

In the first week, we are going to focus on developing and refining the 
recommender system you have built in CCS2.

In the second week, we will finalize the research material to be ready for 
data collection. 

In the third week, we will conduct data analysis and visualize your 
research results.
